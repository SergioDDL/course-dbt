3A. dbt next steps for you 
My company is considering using dbt. I will pitch it as a tool that will help the company build powerful and consistent models. This in turn will be instrumental in 
having reliable data against our KPI's. The power of tests, snapshots and documentation makes this tool ideal. 

The skill i have picked up is how to think logically and SQL.

3B. Setting up for production / scheduled dbt run of your project 
I will look into using Apache Airflow via Astronomer.
